# tfds-pix3d
In this repo, I attempt to create a tensorflow-datasets dataset builder for the Pix3D dataset.

The objective is to extend tensorflow datasets to include the Pix3D dataset and ultimately use it for implementing the MeshRCNN 
paper in tensorflow.

This is as part of the GSoc'20 proposal provided by tensorflow
